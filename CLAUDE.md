# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a minimal repository called "collab-code" that appears to be in its initial state with only a README.md file containing the project name.

## Getting Started

This repository is currently empty except for the README. When developing in this codebase:

1. The repository uses git and is on the `Lev_first_version` branch
2. The main branch for pull requests is `main`
3. No build system, test framework, or linting tools are currently configured

## Next Steps for Development

When adding code to this repository, consider:
- Setting up the appropriate build system based on the programming language chosen
- Adding a package manager configuration (package.json for Node.js, requirements.txt for Python, etc.)
- Configuring linting and formatting tools
- Setting up a test framework
